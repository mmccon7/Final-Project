<h1>My Portfolio, Coming Soon!</h1>
<br>

<p>I am currently attending a Coding Boot-Camp through the University of Arizona. I have been in the higher education industry for the last 5 years and came to the conclusion that I would like to switch careers from adminstration/management to being a software developer. I created this sit to document my journey.</p>
<br>

<p>I will update the site as I learn more.</p>
